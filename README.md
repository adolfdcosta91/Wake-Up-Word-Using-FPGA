# Wake Up Word Using FPGA

This was a "Wake up word" prediction project it was designed on FPGA development kit Dev DE2i-150. This kit uses Altera Cyclon 4 (FPGA). As FPGA have a constraint on resources the front end ran on MATLAB which did most of the pre-processing, as it is resource hungry but the preduction was done on FPGA.

#Requirments 

* Microphone 
* Computer (Matlab)
* DE2i-150 (Altera Cyclon 4 FPGA)
